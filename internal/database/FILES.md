### Summary:  
#### Handler struct:  
The Handler struct is responsible for managing the database connection. It has a single field, DB, which is a pointer to a sql.DB object.  
  
#### NewHandler function:  
The NewHandler function takes a connection string as input and returns a new Handler instance along with an error. It first opens a connection to the database using the provided connection string and the "postgres" driver. If an error occurs during the connection process, it returns nil and the error. Otherwise, it creates a new Handler instance with the opened database connection and returns it.
